goal is to convert a paper into a video. best case we are going to add animations with manim in the end

we first should focus only on arxiv i think this would be the best.

what about just taking the abstract and making a video from that?

1. get paperlink from arxiv
2. download paper in latex
3. make summary 
4. make video from summary -- additional to just having the video spoken out loud we can also add a character like lex fridman for example 

we have this paper and it contains latex, than manim is the special soup. 

the funny demo part of that would be just taking the abstract and. okay what about we are starting of with that. having this paper abstracts on a youtube video. this would be really funny. and than we can adjust the pipeline of arxiv gpt so that also a link to the video is provided. i could just try this out maybe. lets fucking do it, lets be creative. this would be funny actually. i think this would be kinda funny. 

we eventually want to get a manim agent. lets fucking go.
